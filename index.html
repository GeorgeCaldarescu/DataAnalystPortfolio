        <h2>Hi, I am George</h2>
        <p>
          Currently I am a PhD student in plant biology at Charles University in
          Prague. Throughout my undergraduate career I have dealt with data
          analysis that I have accumulated during my experiments. Since then I
          have been expanding my knowledge in this world but with an eye toward
          Data Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider myself a self-taught junior Data Scientist and my line of
          study and my current job are far apart, although some of the skills I
          have learned can be used in other areas outside of the university.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not having much experience in the field I created this portfolio where
          through different projects you can see my skills.
        </p>
